* Task
	* Expand on decks
	* Reprint
* Summary
	*  I am trying once again to print because the only sucessful one from the ultimaker broke
	* I finally got the most basic deck code to run on the drone
	* The extent of this code was giving a printout that said the code was running, but it means I was successful in forcing the deck to be initialized
* Next task
	* Decks with true outputs running on code(turning LEDs on)
* Useful Links
