* Task
	* Fix the printer again(this is getting annoying)
* Summary
	* Did no work with the code because the 3 of the printers needed fixing 
* Once again I needed to fix them 
* We finally found out why they were constantly failing, the PVA had lost all its structural integrity
* We opened up a new spool and tried again
* Next task
	* Finally hopefully get a good print 

* Pictures and Videos
