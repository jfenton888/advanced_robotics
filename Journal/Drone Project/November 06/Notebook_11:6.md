# advanced_robotics 11/6/2017


* Task
	* Fix the printer again(this is getting annoying)
* Summary
	* Did no work with the code because the 3 of the printers needed fixing 
* Once again I needed to fix them 
* We finally found out why they were constantly failing, the PVA had lost all its structural integrity
* We opened up a new spool and tried again
* Next task
	* Finally hopefully get a good print (on either the ultimaker or the makerbot)
* The makerbot print was successful so I now have proof that the STL file is the correct sizing
* Pictures and Videos
	*
