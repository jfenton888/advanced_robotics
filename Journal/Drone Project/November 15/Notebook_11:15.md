* Task
	* Now motors
* Summary
	* It took a long time to get it working but I was able to use the GPIO pins on the drone to turn on LEDs
	* I first stated with a deck that turned on a single LED whenever the drone was tunred on, which helped me realize that GPO actually act like the ground and the other side of the LED needs to be attached to power
	* Afterwards I was able to add 2 more LEDs and run the code for a deck that let me pick which LED was on
		* this was helpful because it meant there was not just a constant output but it was taking inputs from the CF Client
	* I am trying to get the CF to actually take more than a led pin out
* Success
	* Now able to use decks with multiple color leds where I change the color with an input	
* * Next task
	* Get the motors working
* Pictures and Videos
