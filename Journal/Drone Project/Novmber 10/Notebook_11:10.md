* Duration
	* 21:00-00:30 and 16:00-20:00
* Task
	* Adafruit Lesson 9
		* Build the system using the shift register and photo cell, then add on
* Summary
	* I had a lot of trouble getting the shift register working. I did a lot of research into the actual workings of the shift register so I wouldnt just be using it blindly. Then I tried to build the circuit, but had trouble on many different fronts. Once I got help and got the basic function working, I tried out Allen's binary counting code. Then I added the "pot" from lesson 8 to get an understanding of how the photo resistor would be working when I did put it in. Once that circuit was working I decided I needed to add something else to it for fun. I linked the photo resistor to the 3-6 V motor so the more light means faster speed

* Successes
	* got the Shift circuit working 
	* also got the pot and photo resistor curcuits linked to the shift register and added the fan to it
* Issues
	* Couldnt get the shift register working for the longest time
		* Thought the cords were broken or the register or something but I just had the inputs for the Arduino in in the wrong pins
* Next task
	* Next Homework Assignment

* Pictures and Videos
