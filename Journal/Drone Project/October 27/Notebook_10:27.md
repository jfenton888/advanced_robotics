# advanced_robotics 10/27/2017


* Task
	* The printer failed AGAIN (the PVA got clogged by the other filament) and I just can't deal with it so I'm trying again on the development
* Summary
	* I finshed the first version of the circuit board mounting frame, which is pretty much a circle with cutouts for the arms, that will be the next print I try
	* I have been doing a lot of looking through the Forum that Crazyflie hosts for its community, but I am really struggling on finding the setup through mac that works there have been a lot of dead ends
* * Next task
	* Once again fix the printer and find a helpful forum that will show me how to do it

* Pictures and Videos
	* (pictures in October 30 are the first trials of printing the 4th iteration)
	* The makerbot bed was not flat and the Ultimaker failed for an unknown reason
