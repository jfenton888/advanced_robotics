# advanced_robotics 10/20/2017


* Who doesn't love parents weekend yay
* Task 
	* Once again comepletely redo the degign
		* turns out there is something that lets me pattern my design so I only have to do one arm and then I can have it go on all 6
* Over long weekend I want to really improve the model and get it where the it will hold the drone 
* I also need to get started on setting up the development enviroment in Eclipse becuase I have never done anything like this before and it is gonna take a lot of time
* Printer Problem of the day
	* The filament in the picture was all jammed in the filament load, which is not supposed to have an curves, so none of the PVA could come out.
	* I took apart the loader, which had so much pressure that when I took off the last screw it actually shot apart
	* I had to find out how to put it back together and then unclog the extruder, which had baked the last of the filament that had gotten in there because there was no pressure pushing it out due to the clogged loader
