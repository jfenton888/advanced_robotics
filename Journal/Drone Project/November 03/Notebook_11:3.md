* Task
	* Find the errors in the paths

	* Absolutely no success today
	* Trying to print the frame again now on version 7 this should be the final one 
	* I tried the print 3 times over the 24 hours, all horrible failures
	* The PVA seems to be the common problem so going to research problems with the Ultimaker 3 PVA
	* The filament loader seems to keep chewing up the PVA
