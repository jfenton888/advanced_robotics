* Task
	* Use the CF forum that I found that is actually helpful
* I have finally found a useful forum and need to follow it's instructions that it gives
* the forum post is outdated so i have to find what in his instructions is out of date and update it to what needs to be now to upload the firmware
* Next task
	* ReUpload the same firmware that is running on the robot so that I know I am in the correct paths and then make the simple change of an LED color on it so I know I am flashing

* Pictures and Videos
