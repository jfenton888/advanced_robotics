* Task
	* printing again- added an angle to the cutouts where the arms sit to give it room to fit and still keep it snug
	* Use the CF forum that I found that is actually helpful
* I have finally found a useful forum and need to follow it's instructions that it gives
* the forum post is outdated so i have to find what in his instructions is out of date and update it to what needs to be now to upload the firmware
