# advanced_robotics 10/18/2017


* Task
	* Working with Fusion
		* learnig how to draw shapes and make them into 3 dimensional versions
		* Improve the first model I made on Fusion
		* pretty much involved starting it again from scratch and making a more direct pattern, as a lot from the original was not actually doing anything
* Summary
	* This is not an easy thing to learn. I have a very clear picture in my head of what I want it to look like but I dont know how to turn that into a reality.
	* I want 6 arms, each attached to the vertical strut of the hexagon, but its so hard to get all the measurements perfect
	* Charlie just showed me how to extrude things around a point so that eases this up so much
	* Outside of class I did a lot of work- I just scrapped the old version and remade it with many less commands and set it up to print on a reallt fast setting 
* Next task
	* see how that goes and fix whatever needs fixing
