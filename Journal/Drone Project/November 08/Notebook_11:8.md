* Task
	* Print again 
	* Get the code running
* Summary
	* The print failed again so I'm just trying to print it again because there should be nothing wrong with it 
	* I finally got the original firmware to upload, and I can change the color of the LED
* Next task
	* Add decks to the code to get it to run expansion
* Printer recap---I did finally get a successful print, and it looks so good
	* I put it in water for a few hours and then put 4 motors in the mounts and flew it with original code,
	* It flew, albeit badly and broke upon the 4th crash
