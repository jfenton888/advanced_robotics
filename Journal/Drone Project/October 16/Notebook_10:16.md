# advanced_robotics 10/16/2017


* Task
	* Getting started
* Summary
	* My gant chart's progression was a fairly simple task- two seperate tasks that can happen nearly concurrently–––> Creating a frame and Writing the code
	* Talked with Charlie about what my best option is for creating the frame, going to be using Fusion instead of sketchup
	* I now know that I will be using fusion and I can start planning out the design itself
	* Turns out it is not something you can pickup on the first day so I will have to learn this new program 
* Looking Forward
	* Learning Fusion's ins and outs and then trying to get Eclipse up and running on my computer
