* Assignment- Lasercut something we find cool/interesting
	* I looked through thingiverse for a couple of minutes before finding something that I thought was pretty cool and had the potential to be very useful, laser cut heavy duty stackable boxes that could possibly replace the plastic yellow bins in the lab now and would fit better with the theme of the room

	* I downloaded the svg files and Charlie was about to help me format them on adobe when the laser cutter went awry and we changed course
	* We shut off the cutter and covered it up
