Response to podcast on the Ladybird Robot being developed in Australia. 
Questions

* What is the goal of this project?
* What limitations exist for the system?
* Are there factors being simplified?
* Who is the Consumer here?
* Is this the only project this team has done before in this field?
* What are the potential implications of this being more widespread?


This project is being done in the hopes of automating the farming industry. The Ladybird robot is capable of traversing the entire crop field using omni-directional wheels and rolling down the troughes in the fields. It has a large number of sensors that can map many different elements of the crops it is monotoring. It also has a dual purpose set of solar pannels that keep the electrical components from overheating as well as extending its life before needing to recharge. It simplifies the process of surveying the crops and eliminates human error and inconcistincies. Not only does it map the crops, it is also capable of de weeding the fields. It learns from its experiences to better identify what weeds look like. The researchers on this project are experts in their  field(pun intended), specifically James Underwood who is studies how outdoor robots work in unstructured enviroments. If he and his team are able to perfect the Ladybird it could have surastic implications on the farming industry, their end consumer. Farmers would not need to employ work hands to toil the field, but just these robots to maintain the crops and monitor their progress.
