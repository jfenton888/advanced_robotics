* Duration
	* 9/28: Class time
* Task
	* Time trial where we had to get the set of 8 LEDs in the shift register to go on one by one and when the 8th is turned on a buzzer goes too
		* Summary
	*Started off with the old shift register code that turned the leds on in sequence. After it was running again I had to get it running a buzzer and decided to have the pitch alter with the amount of leds lit at any point
* Successes
	* Got it running quickly 
* Issues
	* Had trouble getting the old code working because I was trying to use new syntax that wasn't working as expected
	
* Pictures and Videos
