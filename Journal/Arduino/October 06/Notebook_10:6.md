# advanced_robotics 10/6/2017


* In class
		* Di Tieri showed us some of the other options for making things in the I.D. Lab, including the 3D printers and a possible software we could use to make stl files
* Assignment- Print out a phone case that we put a twist on
	* We spent most of class exploring the different generative designs we could chose from
	* I added a series of hexagons to the back of a phone case, and then decided to sink them in and make them holes in the design, but the .stl had a problem and wouldn’t allow shapes to merge with them
	* Picked a new .stl file that ran more smoothly on tinker cad and made the hexagons holes
	* Elise and I were running out of time so we had to put our files on the same buildplate to make it so we could both actually turn in our prints in time because there was only one working printer available
	* Feldman put an extruder on the makerbot that only works on tough PLA, so we were worried we wouldn’t have enough filament to print- not that we had to worry because it apparently stopped printing at 10pm and didn’t print overnight
		* Update: the print worked very well once it finished actually finished printing

* Successes
	* I looks pretty damn cool
* Issues
	* The original file I tried to use was not conducive to editing(same one elise had trouble with) and because I dont know the software I thought it was a problem with that 
	* There were no availible printers to use/the one that was open to use had been set up so it couldnt be used much
		* Because it was tough PLA it takes a different extruder and he took the old one 
* Next task
	* Laser cutter and making sure the print finishes
* Update: It finished and looks really good
