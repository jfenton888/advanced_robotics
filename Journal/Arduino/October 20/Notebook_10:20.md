# advanced_robotics 9/17/2017


* Who doesn't love parents weekend yay
* Task 
	* Fix the print and expand upon the model
	* The print completely failed becuase the PVA filament that I need for this project was completely screwed up.
		* it was wound up inside itself really badly and the extruder head was clogged
	* I tried to do what I could but the extruder was too badly clogged for me to fix so Ill have to wait till feldman comes back and fixes it
* Over long weekend I want to really improve the model and get it where the it will hold the drone 
* I also need to get started on setting up the development enviroment in Eclipse becuase I have never done anything like this before and it is gonna take a lot of time
