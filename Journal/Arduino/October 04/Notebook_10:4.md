* Duration
	* Class Time + 11:00- 12:30(afternoon)
* Task
	* In class assessment, fixing a motor
		* Problem with motor: motor with intact wires that were in good condition, but the pins on the end had been broken off
			* Solution: decided to cut wires shorter, crimp them to a new, longer section and add pins to the end of the new section
		* Process
			* Cut off the end of the old pins from the end of the wires, and stripped the new ends of the wire
			* Connected the exposed ends of the wire to power and ground to check if the motor was working through that point–– result: motor worked (img 1)
			* Extended each wire by crimping them to a new wire of corresponding color by crimping them with butts(right side of img 2)
			* Checked if motor worked with the crimped wires as the ends––motor worked
		* Last step was attaching the pins and putting them in the housing
			* Did some tests on separate pieces to make sure I got the soldering just right before doing it on the actual motors
			*  Folded the pieces of pin that kept it in place before solder
			*  Required heating up the lower end of the pin for a long time from both the top and bottom and then put the solder in through the top so it melted inside and made the best connection without taking up space outside the pin(img 3)

		* Successes
	* I was really happy with the appearance of the end product, even though …
* Issues
	* Because it was my first time doing this, it took a long time to figure out
* Next task
	* Not sure
